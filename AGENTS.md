# AGENTS — Project Sonora (Training Repo)

This is the entry point for any agent or developer working on Project Sonora's training
codebase. This is an independent GitHub repo (the PyTorch training pipeline that produces the
actor model artifacts published to the `Sonora-HF` sibling repo). Internal engineering notes —
architecture, current state, open decisions — live in [notes/](notes/). Before starting work,
read [notes/STATE.md](notes/STATE.md) for the current state of the project and the most
immediate must-do items.

## Core Stack Matrix

* **Language Ecosystem:** Python-based ML training pipeline.
* **Core Framework:** PyTorch & Matcha-TTS (conditional flow-matching).
* **Environment:** AMD ROCm PyTorch Docker container (optimized for Ryzen AI Max+).

---

## Integration Dependencies

* This repo is a standalone PyTorch training repository for building, fine-tuning, and
  exporting voice actor models (Matcha-TTS). It is consumed by Project Prosodia
  (`ProsodiaActor`) via exported artifacts promoted into the `Sonora-HF` sibling repo (a
  directly checked-out HF model repo, superseding the old `Sonora/huggingface` gitignored-clone
  layout from the umbrella-workspace era).

---

## File Naming Conventions

Names must be predictable so links resolve on case-sensitive systems (Linux/CI) as well as
case-insensitive macOS/Windows.

* **Canonical root marker files → `UPPERCASE`** (`SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` if multi-word): `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `AGENTS.md`. Keep this set small and curated.
* **Top-level anchor docs → `UPPERCASE`, single word preferred:** `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `STATE.md`.
* **All other docs & notes → `lowercase-kebab-case.md`:** e.g. `open-decisions.md`, `code-review-findings.md`. This is the rule for everything in `notes/`.
* **Source code → the language's own convention:** Rust `snake_case.rs`, Swift `PascalCase.swift`, Kotlin `PascalCase.kt`.
* **Never** let case be the only difference between two paths, and always reference files with their exact case.

## System Operational Mandates

### 1. Commit Hygiene

* **Pull before push, every time.** The Mac and `ai-lab-0` (and their agent sessions) commit to
  the same `main` branch concurrently: run `git pull --rebase` as the first step of any
  commit-and-push sequence. If the tree holds the owner's uncommitted local edits, fetch and
  check ahead/behind instead of forcing a rebase.

### 2. Training & Troubleshooting Mandates

* **Training Workspace**: Training runs inside the ROCm Docker container (named `sonora_training`), whose compose definition lives in the `AI-Lab-AMD` sibling repo.
* **Active Log Review**:
  * To inspect the training progress, check the container logs directly: `docker logs sonora_training` or `docker logs -f sonora_training`.
  * Local execution metrics, hydra configurations, checkpoints, and tensorboard events are output directly to `logs/`.
* **Common Troubleshooting and Fixes**:
  * *Audio Decoding Failures (ROCm CUDA Mismatch)*: `torchaudio.load()` defaults to `torchcodec`, which fails inside the ROCm container due to missing CUDA dynamic libraries. Always use `soundfile.read(..., dtype='float32')` and convert to PyTorch tensors manually (see implementation in [matcha/data/text_mel_datamodule.py](matcha/data/text_mel_datamodule.py)).
  * *Matplotlib AttributeError in Validation*: Matplotlib 3.9+ removes `tostring_rgb()`. Use `np.asarray(fig.canvas.buffer_rgba())[:, :, :3]` instead (see implementation in [matcha/utils/utils.py](matcha/utils/utils.py)).
  * *Isolated build failures (NumPy 1.24.3 source compilation on Python 3.12)*: Pre-install `Cython` and run `uv pip install --no-build-isolation -e .` to reuse container-native compiled libraries.
  * *Local Gitignore Masking*: This repo's root `.gitignore` must contain `/data` (not recursive `data`) to avoid ignoring source code folders like `matcha/data/`.
* **Continuing Forward**: If a container run fails, apply the fix, commit to this repository, and relaunch via the GitOps compose stack — `docker compose --profile training up -d sonora_training` from the `AI-Lab-AMD` repo (the service is profile-gated so ordinary syncs never start it). Container state is ephemeral: recreation wipes `/tmp` and pip installs, so copy artifacts out immediately (to `/data/model-training/…`, or promote blessed ones into the `Sonora-HF` registry repo).

### 3. Python Tooling Mandate — uv

* **`uv` is the standard for all Python tooling in this organization**: interpreter/version
  management, virtual environments, dependency resolution, and tool execution. Prefer `uv pip`,
  `uv venv`, `uv run`, `uv sync` (with `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`), and `uv tool run` over bare
  `pip` / `python -m venv` / `pipx` / conda / poetry.
* **New work must use uv from the start** — new scripts, containers, CI steps, and docs. Do not
  introduce new `pip install` invocations.
* **Existing pip usage is legacy** and is being migrated; the catalog of migration points and their
  done-criteria lives in [AI-Lab-AMD/notes/cleanup-chores.md](../AI-Lab-AMD/notes/cleanup-chores.md)
  in the `AI-Lab-AMD` sibling repo. When touching a file that contains legacy pip usage, migrate it
  as part of the change when practical (small diffs, e.g. `pip install X` → `uv pip install
  --system X` in containers), rather than leaving new debt.
* **Containers**: the `rocm/pytorch`-based service commands should bootstrap uv (single static
  binary — `pip install uv` once or `COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv`) and then install runtime
  deps with **`uv pip install --python /opt/venv/bin/python`** — these images ship their stack in
  an `/opt/venv` activated via PATH, and `--system` bypasses it into Debian's externally-managed
  Python, which refuses installs (PEP 668; learned 2026-07-13 when the first `--system` deploy
  crash-looped two services). Use `--system` only in images whose Python truly is the system one.
  uv's resolver speed materially shortens the recreate-reinstall cycle documented in this
  project's STATE ops notes.
