# AGENTS — Project Sonora (Training Repo)

This is the entry point for any agent or developer working on Project Sonora's training
codebase. This is an independent GitHub repo (the PyTorch training pipeline that produces the
actor model artifacts published to the `Sonora/huggingface` sibling checkout). Internal engineering notes —
architecture, current state, open decisions — live in [notes/](notes/), mapped one-line-per-file
in [notes/README.md](notes/README.md). Before starting work, read
[notes/STATE.md](notes/STATE.md) for the current state of the project and
[notes/todo.md](notes/todo.md) for the open work.

## Core Stack Matrix

* **Language Ecosystem:** Python-based ML training pipeline.
* **Second lane — teacher synthesis (`scripts/synthesis/`):** five audited TTS engines
  (`chatterbox`, `qwen`, `zonos`, `orpheus`, `moss_vg`; `vibevoice` + `dia` are set aside,
  reversible — `ref_select.SET_ASIDE`) driven by a two-pass Gemma director — per-line
  V/A/T + a register copied from the 47-label controlled lexicon
  (`scripts/synthesis/register_lexicon.json`), then per-engine casting/delivery from
  `scripts/synthesis/director_skills/<engine>.md`. Engine allocation is the three-layer
  `ref_select.ENGINE_MIX_BY_LANE` (capability veto · measured per-lane weights ·
  diversity floor). **`build_direction()` in `book_ingest.py` is the single source of
  truth for what each engine actually receives — never bypass it; unknown engines are fatal.**
  The 2026-07-25 relay audit found rich direction had been silently dropped by every engine.
  **Standing rule:** no TTS model enters the portfolio without a studied interface and a
  Gemma skill-file adapter — see [notes/tts-engine-onboarding.md](notes/tts-engine-onboarding.md),
  which also carries the known-gotchas reference. Minimum clip length is **4 s of estimated
  speech**, gating input text (not render duration).
* **Core Framework:** PyTorch & Matcha-TTS (conditional flow-matching).
* **Environment:** AMD ROCm PyTorch Docker container (optimized for Ryzen AI Max+).

---

## Integration Dependencies

* **Deployed code is a copy; the repo is the source** — see §6 and [notes/data-mirrors.md](notes/data-mirrors.md).
* This repo is a standalone PyTorch training repository for building, fine-tuning, and
  exporting voice actor models (Matcha-TTS). It is consumed by Project Prosodia
  (`ProsodiaActor`) via exported artifacts promoted into the sibling **`Sonora/huggingface`**
  checkout — a direct clone of `artificial-humanity/Sonora` alongside this repo's
  `Sonora/github`, under the flat workspace layout adopted 2026-07-22 (the umbrella workspace
  is gone). Lineage and `current` flags live in its `registry.json`.

---

## File Naming Conventions

Names must be predictable so links resolve on case-sensitive systems (Linux/CI) as well as
case-insensitive macOS/Windows.

* **Canonical root marker files → `UPPERCASE`** (`SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` if multi-word): `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `AGENTS.md`. Keep this set small and curated.
* **Top-level anchor docs → `UPPERCASE`, single word preferred:** `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `STATE.md`.
* **All other docs & notes → `lowercase-kebab-case.md`:** e.g. `open-decisions.md`, `code-review-findings.md`. This is the rule for everything in `notes/`.
* **Source code → the language's own convention:** Rust `snake_case.rs`, Swift `PascalCase.swift`, Kotlin `PascalCase.kt`.
* **Never** let case be the only difference between two paths, and always reference files with their exact case.

---

## System Operational Mandates

### 1. Commit Hygiene

* **Pull before push, every time.** The Mac and `ai-lab-0` (and their agent sessions) commit to
  the same `main` branch concurrently: run `git pull --rebase` as the first step of any
  commit-and-push sequence. If the tree holds the owner's uncommitted local edits, fetch and
  check ahead/behind instead of forcing a rebase.

### 2. Training & Troubleshooting Mandates

* **Training Workspace**: Training runs inside the ROCm Docker container (named `sonora_training`), whose compose definition lives in the `AI-Lab-AMD` sibling repo.
* **Active Log Review**:
  * To inspect the training progress, check the container logs directly: `docker logs sonora_training` or `docker logs -f sonora_training`.
  * Local execution metrics, hydra configurations, checkpoints, and tensorboard events are output directly to `logs/`.
* **Common Troubleshooting and Fixes**:
  * *Audio Decoding Failures (ROCm CUDA Mismatch)*: `torchaudio.load()` defaults to `torchcodec`, which fails inside the ROCm container due to missing CUDA dynamic libraries. Always use `soundfile.read(..., dtype='float32')` and convert to PyTorch tensors manually (see implementation in [matcha/data/text_mel_datamodule.py](matcha/data/text_mel_datamodule.py)).
  * *Matplotlib AttributeError in Validation*: Matplotlib 3.9+ removes `tostring_rgb()`. Use `np.asarray(fig.canvas.buffer_rgba())[:, :, :3]` instead (see implementation in [matcha/utils/utils.py](matcha/utils/utils.py)).
  * *Isolated build failures (NumPy 1.24.3 source compilation on Python 3.12)*: Pre-install `Cython` and run `uv pip install --no-build-isolation -e .` to reuse container-native compiled libraries.
  * *Local Gitignore Masking*: This repo's root `.gitignore` must contain `/data` (not recursive `data`) to avoid ignoring source code folders like `matcha/data/`.
* **Continuing Forward**: If a container run fails, apply the fix, commit to this repository, then **relaunch explicitly** (committing deploys nothing — GitOps was retired 2026-07-22; service deploys go through `AI-Lab-AMD/scripts/deploy.sh`) — `docker compose --profile training up -d sonora_training` from the `AI-Lab-AMD` repo (the service is profile-gated so ordinary syncs never start it). Container state is ephemeral: recreation wipes `/tmp` and pip installs, so copy artifacts out immediately (to `/data/model-training/…`, or promote blessed ones into the `Sonora/huggingface` registry checkout).

### 3. Python Tooling Mandate — uv

* **`uv` is the standard for all Python tooling in this organization**: interpreter/version
  management, virtual environments, dependency resolution, and tool execution. Prefer `uv pip`,
  `uv venv`, `uv sync` (with `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`), and `uv tool run` over bare
  `pip` / `python -m venv` / `pipx` / conda / poetry.
* **`uv run` is the one exception, and only for HOST scripts** (owner, 2026-08-01). Invoke them
  as **`.venv/bin/python scripts/…`**. `uv run` resolves dependencies against the repo
  `pyproject.toml` and *ignores* the inline PEP 723 block these scripts carry, which is what made
  four launch attempts fail that day, each on a different missing module. uv still owns the venv —
  create it with `uv venv`, populate it with `uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python …` — so the
  standard above is intact; only the invocation changes. Container scripts are unaffected.
  `tests/test_gate_scripts.py` enforces this for both shell scripts and Python docs.
* **New work must use uv from the start** — new scripts, containers, CI steps, and docs. Do not
  introduce new `pip install` invocations.
* **Existing pip usage is legacy** and is being migrated; the catalog of migration points and their
  done-criteria lives in [AI-Lab-AMD/notes/cleanup-chores.md](../../AI-Lab-AMD/notes/cleanup-chores.md)
  in the `AI-Lab-AMD` sibling repo. When touching a file that contains legacy pip usage, migrate it
  as part of the change when practical (small diffs, e.g. `pip install X` → `uv pip install
  --system X` in containers), rather than leaving new debt.
* **Containers**: the `rocm/pytorch`-based service commands should bootstrap uv (single static
  binary — `pip install uv` once or `COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv`) and then install runtime
  deps with **`uv pip install --python /opt/venv/bin/python`** — these images ship their stack in
  an `/opt/venv` activated via PATH, and `--system` bypasses it into Debian's externally-managed
  Python, which refuses installs (PEP 668; learned 2026-07-13 when the first `--system` deploy
  crash-looped two services). Use `--system` only in images whose Python truly is the system one.
  uv's resolver speed materially shortens the recreate-reinstall cycle documented in this
  project's STATE ops notes.

### 4. Changelog Maintenance Requirement

* The project changelog lives at [notes/CHANGELOG.md](notes/CHANGELOG.md). Append a detailed chronological entry describing all technical modifications, refactoring milestones, and build-system changes **after committing** the corresponding work.
* **Scope: code work only.** Changelog entries are required for source, config, and dependency-manifest changes (`matcha/`, `scripts/`, `configs/`, `tests/`, `sky/`, `vocalizer.py`, `audition/`, `Makefile`, `pyproject.toml`/`setup.py`/`environments/`). They are **not** required for docs-only commits (`notes/`, `notebooks/`, `*.md`, comments-only changes).
* Every entry must be accompanied by the short 7-character commit SHA associated with the work.
* **The changelog is append-only across a release cycle.** Do not prune, rewrite, or remove historical entries. Entries are pruned/rolled over **only** when we tag and release a new version of the overall project — at which point the released entries are collected under that version's heading and the working section is reset for the next cycle.
* New entries go at the top under the current date, following the existing `Added` / `Changed` / `Fixed` / `Removed` structure.

### 5. Code Review Execution Standards

* **Scope: code work only.** Code reviews cover the same code changes that warrant changelog entries (see §4) — source, configs, and dependency manifests. Docs-only commits are out of scope and need no review.
* When performing a code review, cross-reference the changelog and corresponding commits.
* Create a review document matching the format `notes/code-review-[year][month][day]-[hhmmss].md`. Begin the document with the first evaluated short commit SHA, and end with the last evaluated commit SHA.
* Determine the range of commits to review by starting with the commit immediately following the end SHA of the *previous* code review. If no prior review exists, use all commits from the previous and current day.
* Once the new code review document has been written, delete the previous one to keep only the latest review active.
* Repoint the **Latest code review** pointer in [notes/STATE.md](notes/STATE.md) to the new document (only the link target changes; the surrounding line is phrased generically) so a session can find the current review without globbing the folder.

### 6. Execute From The Repo — `/data` Holds Data

**Owner principle (2026-08-06): code executes from the repo checkout; `/data` holds what
its name implies** — datasets, checkpoints, model artifacts, venvs, training logs, service
runtime state, vendor checkouts. A byte-copy of our source under `/data` is something to
*remove*, not to manage. The full inventory, what is legitimately untracked, and the audit
behind this rule are in [notes/data-mirrors.md](notes/data-mirrors.md).

* **When a tool writes its outputs next to its own source** — the usual reason a `/data`
  copy exists at all — give it an artifact-root variable defaulting to the script's own
  directory, point that at `/data`, and delete the copy. That is the shape that satisfies
  both halves. Worked example: `SONORA_LITERT_WORK` and
  [scripts/litert_export/run.sh](scripts/litert_export/run.sh).
* **For containers, bind-mount the repo path**, not a `/data` copy of it.

Where a copy still exists, the rest of this section governs it. **The repo is
authoritative in every case.**

* **Never edit code under `/data`.** Change it in the repo, commit, then deploy. An edit made
  on `/data` has no history, no diff, no review and no changelog entry, and no way for anyone
  else to discover it happened.
* **A `/data` file that is *newer* than its tracked original is not authoritative — it is
  unreviewed.** If that edit is the one you want, commit it in the repo and redeploy; do not
  let the copy become the record.
* **Deploy explicitly.** Committing deploys nothing (GitOps retired 2026-07-22). Service
  stacks go through `AI-Lab-AMD/scripts/deploy.sh`; the training clone at `/data/repos/Sonora`
  through `deploy.sh training-code`.
* **Adding a tool that will run from `/data`? Add it to `MIRRORS` in
  [tests/test_data_mirrors.py](tests/test_data_mirrors.py) in the same commit.** That gate
  compares every tracked file against its deployed copy and fails on any difference. It is the
  only thing standing between us and this failure mode, and it only covers what it is told
  about.
* **What legitimately lives only on `/data`, and must stay untracked:** venvs, `artifacts*/`,
  checkpoints, training logs, datasets, vendor checkouts (`toolchain/Zonos`,
  `services/comfyui`, `services/unsloth`, …) and service runtime state.

**Why this is a mandate and not a preference.** A copy that stops updating looks exactly like
a copy that is up to date — both directories are healthy, the scripts run, and the only
symptom is that a fix you believe shipped did not. It has already happened twice:

* `convert_vat.py` on `/data` ran **three weeks stale**, missing the `detect_vat_dim` seam
  guard that this repo recorded as landed. The guard was written, reviewed, committed and
  never installed.
* The training deploy clone went **dead for two weeks** in July, because `deploy.sh
  training-code`'s fast-forward pull cannot cross a history rewrite and failed silently.

Neither was found by noticing something break. Both were found by going to look.

### 7. The Deploy Cycle — repo → `/data`, and the check that comes FIRST

§6 says *why* the repo is authoritative. This is the *procedure*, and it is mandatory for
every target with a `/data` copy. Canonised 2026-08-08, when `audition/` moved into this repo
and the cycle stopped being another repo's internal business.

**Targets, and where each is sourced from.** `scripts/deploy.sh` lives in `AI-Lab-AMD`
because it is box tooling, but it deploys from whichever repo owns the code:

| target | source | command |
|---|---|---|
| `audition` → `/data/services/audition/app` | **this repo**, `audition/` | `deploy.sh audition` |
| `training-code` → `/data/repos/Sonora` | **this repo** (ff-pull; a real checkout) | `deploy.sh training-code` |
| `dashboard` → `/data/services/dashboard` | `AI-Lab-AMD/dashboard` | `deploy.sh dashboard` |
| `stack` → the compose services | `AI-Lab-AMD` | `deploy.sh stack` |

#### 0 · BEFORE touching related code — confirm the deployed copy is current

**This step comes first and is the point of the section.**

```bash
../../AI-Lab-AMD/scripts/deploy.sh status                  # which revision is running
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_data_mirrors.py -q   # do the bytes still match
```

A target reading **STALE**, **DIRTY**, or *"deployed from a commit not in this repo"* means
the running copy is not the code you are about to edit. Editing on top of that and then
deploying **silently clobbers** whatever was actually live — and since `rsync --delete` is
not recoverable, there is nothing left to diff. Resolve drift *before* the first edit.

Not hypothetical: `convert_vat.py` ran **three weeks stale** on `/data` — the repo gained a
`detect_vat_dim` seam guard, the notes recorded it as landed, and the harness that actually
executed never received it. *A guard that is not installed is not a guard*, and the only
symptom was that a fix believed shipped had not.

#### 1 · Edit in the repo · 2 · Commit · 3 · Deploy · 4 · Verify

```bash
git commit …                                    # a dirty tree is REFUSED by deploy.sh
../../AI-Lab-AMD/scripts/deploy.sh <target>
../../AI-Lab-AMD/scripts/deploy.sh status       # the target should now read `current`
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_data_mirrors.py -q
```

**Never edit under `/data` and copy back.** An edit there has no history, no diff, no review
and no changelog entry. A `/data` file that is *newer* is not authoritative — it is unrecorded.

#### Rules that travel with the cycle

* **Register a new target in the same commit that first deploys it.** `MIRRORS` in
  `tests/test_data_mirrors.py` covers only what it is told about, and
  `test_there_is_something_to_check` exists so a layout change cannot quietly empty it.
* **A contract the deployed copy needs must be SHIPPED, never transcribed.** The audition app
  cannot import `matcha` — its container has fastapi and uvicorn and nothing else — so
  `deploy.sh` copies `matcha/delivery.py` into `app/_contract/` **after** the `rsync --delete`,
  and the app **refuses to start** without it. Same pattern as the device G2P's exported
  `g2p_contractions.json`. A fallback to a literal would re-create the fork the asset exists
  to delete; D-C1's lesson is that a hand-synced table is a defect of omission on a delay.
* **Staleness is judged per source PATH, by ancestry** — against the last commit touching that
  target's own path, never against repo HEAD. A HEAD comparison called `dashboard` BEHIND for
  a week while it was perfectly current, and a check that cries wolf gets ignored, which is
  worse than no check.
* **A dirty tree is refused.** `ALLOW_DIRTY=1` overrides and the stamp records that it was
  used, so the exception leaves a trace.
